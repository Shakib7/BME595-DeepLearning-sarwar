#Convolution function implemented in C is faster than Python by 50x on an average.
#There are 24 resultant images instead of 12. 12 extra images begining with 'N_' are the normalized form [0-255] of the convolution outputs.
#The convolution functions (both in C and Python) provide correct results. However, not sure whether the output images are saved in a correct manner, therefore the resultant images do not give clear idea about the tranformation operation done by the convolution.
